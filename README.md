# DriveBy — SF Multi-Agent RL Driving Environment

A browser-based reinforcement learning environment set in real San Francisco downtown. Ten autonomous car agents drive simultaneously through the SF Financial District, each wired for backend-driven policy actions. A human player can take control at any time using WASD keys.

Built on top of [SynthCity](https://github.com/jeffbeene/synthcity) by Jeff Beene — the Three.js renderer setup and Bladerunner Sedan car model are derived from that project.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Map & 3D buildings | Mapbox GL JS (3D buildings, real SF geometry) |
| 3D agents & scene | Three.js (custom Mapbox layer) |
| Physics & collision | Rapier.js (WASM, runs in browser) |
| Web server | Node.js + Express |
| Real-time comms | WebSocket |
| RL backend | Python PyTorch policy over WebSocket |

---

## How to Run

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v18+
- npm (comes with Node)
- Python 3 with `torch` and `websocket-client`

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the full dev stack

```bash
npm run dev
```

This clears ports `3000` and `3001`, starts webpack in watch mode, starts the Express server, starts the WebSocket relay, and launches the Python PyTorch RL backend.

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Start components individually

```bash
npm start
npm run rl:backend
```

The in-app backend indicator should show `backend-connected`, and `RL controlled` should update as action messages arrive.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `W` / `Arrow Up` | Accelerate |
| `S` / `Arrow Down` | Brake / reverse |
| `A` / `Arrow Left` | Steer left |
| `D` / `Arrow Right` | Steer right |
| `C` | Toggle bird's eye / follow camera |

## Connecting the RL Backend

The browser sends observations to the RL backend through `ws://localhost:3001?type=browser`. The PyTorch backend connects through `ws://localhost:3001?type=rl_backend`.

1. Start the full stack (`npm run dev`)
2. Or start components individually with `npm start` and `npm run rl:backend`
3. Receive observation JSON, send back action JSON per the message format below

**Observation (browser → backend):**
```json
{
  "type": "observations",
  "tick": 1234,
  "agents": [{ "id": 0, "state": [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6], "collided": false, "score": 12.3 }]
}
```

**Action (backend → browser):**
```json
{
  "type": "actions",
  "tick": 1234,
  "agents": [{ "id": 0, "throttle": 0.8, "steering": -0.2, "brake": 0.0 }]
}
```
